The repository is structured as a yarn monorepo and largely consists of codemod-kit packages and a website.

First, run yarn install to install dependencies.

## packages

The main function of the package is to execute predefined transforms using jscodeshift.

This package mainly consists of two files for providing cli and programmatic methods, and one more file for running the transformer in a browser.

When adding new transformers or options, please take care to add test code and documentation for them.

## webstie

The website is built with docusarus and can be run from root via `yarn start:website`.

If you want to edit a document, try editing it in the docs or transformer folder.

If you need to modify a playground, browse inside `src/page/playground`.
