## Issue Claiming

Anything is fine, be it a bug, documentation request, feature suggestion, etc. Please post it in the issue.

Please select an issue template, fill in the required fields, and submit. We will review and edit/comment on your content as quickly as possible.

> Please also post questions about features as issues so that we can document and work on preventing such questions from occurring in the future.

## Finding Issues

For issues with the help wanted label, you can create a pr after working on them without asking permission. 

However, since you may be doing duplicate work, it is better to prevent this by specifying this in the issue or linking a pr in the wip state.

> If this is your first contribution, look for issues labeled good first issue
